        Hi, I'm Fran, a software engineer with a passion for cycling and
        photography. This blog is my journey of exploration and discovery, where
        I share personal reflections, experiences from my rides, and the moments
        I capture through my lens. I aim to offer value through thoughtful
        insights on life, practical tips on software development, and
        recommendations for books and music that inspire me. Join me as we
        explore these passions and find new ways to enrich our lives together.
