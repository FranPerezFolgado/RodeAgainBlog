## How to Give Your Projects an Identity to Stay Motivated: A Lesson I Learned from Ikigai

Have you ever started a project or routine with the best intentions only to abandon it a few weeks later? If you’re like me, you’ve probably tried countless ways to improve yourself and be the best version of yourself, but somewhere along the way, you lose motivation. This has happened to me many times. I’m always seeking new ways to move forward, but eventually, those ideas end up half-finished.

One of the last books I read, about **Ikigai**, offered a new perspective. Not only did it dive deep into the concept of **ikigai**, but it also provided practical advice on how to pursue your passions. One thing that really caught my attention was the idea of **giving your projects an identity**. According to the book, **“when something has a name, it exists forever”**. The key to making a project come to life is to give it a catchy name that inspires you to keep working on it.

### Why Naming Your Projects Matters

The name doesn’t have to be final. As the project evolves, you may find a name that suits it better. It doesn’t matter if the name feels “cringy” or absurd—what’s important is that it motivates you. Plus, you don’t need to hide the name or the project. Instead, **share it with your friends and family**. Giving it visibility reinforces your commitment to it.

### My Experience with This Approach

As I was reading the book, I had just started this blog, which gave me the perfect opportunity to apply this idea. After a long, creative night (with little sleep), I came up with the name **RodeAgain**. I found it incredibly motivating. From that moment on, I couldn’t stop thinking about ways to improve the blog and keep moving the project forward.

I’m going to apply this concept to other areas of my life as well, such as cycling, where I’ve been struggling with consistency. I’ll find a name that motivates me to keep pedaling because I firmly believe that **giving our projects an identity is a key step to staying motivated**.

### Final Recommendation

I highly recommend this book on Ikigai, as it’s full of insights for following your passions. I’ll be sharing more reflections and lessons from the book in future posts. Thanks for reading!
