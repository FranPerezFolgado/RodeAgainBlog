Recently, I received some frustrating news at work—I wasn't assigned to a new project. For context, I work at a software consultancy, and during the summer months, I was assigned to a project. Once it ended, I hoped to be placed on something new. However, I was told that there wasn't a project for me to work on.

Now, being paid without having to do any work might sound like a dream, but after just three days, I quickly became bored. I tried pushing for a new project, but in the meantime, I started procrastinating—playing video games, skipping my routines, eating junk food, and generally neglecting my well-being. This spiraled into a two-week slump where I avoided thinking about my situation and evaded all responsibilities. 

**Sometimes, we get trapped in a cycle of misery without even realizing it.**

Then came Sunday—a day I typically reserve for reflection. For me, Sundays are about journaling and checking in on my goals. That particular Sunday, I realized just how badly I'd let things slip. I was in the worst mental and physical state I'd been in all year. I started feeling hopeless, like I couldn't break free from the rut.

But then I remembered something: **I just needed a small victory to break out of the loop.**

This is something I've learned from reading self-improvement books and through lots of self-reflection. One book that really helped me was **"Your Head is a Houseboat"**. It includes journaling exercises that encourage you to understand yourself better and stay present. After consistently journaling both in good times and bad, I discovered that I thrive on small victories. 

So, I grabbed a notebook and wrote down everything I wanted to do. After two weeks of doing nothing, the list was long: cleaning, exercising, writing, reading... But I knew from experience that exercising was the key for me. **It's important to prioritize the one thing you know will help the most**. This might be different for everyone, but if you're unsure what works for you, it's time to invest in getting to know yourself better.

I decided to exercise, knowing that it would pull me back to reality and give me the boost I needed. Afterward, I felt reinvigorated—strong enough to tackle everything else on my list. That small victory reminded me that I'm capable and that things aren't as difficult as they seem.

By focusing on **small victories**, you're able to pull yourself out of a negative spiral, no matter how deep you feel stuck. It’s about building momentum, one step at a time. And sometimes, that first step is all you need to shift your perspective and regain control.
